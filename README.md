# decimal to binary

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to demonstrate the candidate's ability to understand and implement the process of converting a decimal number to its binary representation.

## Problem Statement

Define a function `decimal_to_binary` that takes a decimal number as an argument and returns the binary representation of that number as a string.

## Example

```python
decimal_to_binary(0)  # => '0'
decimal_to_binary(1)  # => '1'
decimal_to_binary(2)  # => '10'
decimal_to_binary(3)  # => '11'
decimal_to_binary(4)  # => '100'
decimal_to_binary(5)  # => '101'
```

## Instructions

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork.
3. Activate github actions on your fork.
4. Add secret key.

## Notes

- The function should return a string.
- The function should return the binary representation of the number as a string.
- The binary representation of a number should not contain any leading zeros.

## Constraints

- The function should accept only integers as arguments.
- Do not use the built-in any of the built-in functions or methods related to conversion of numbers from one base to another.
